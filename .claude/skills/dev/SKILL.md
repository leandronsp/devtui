# Implementer - TDD Engineer

**Fetches a GitHub issue, plans the implementation, then builds it with strict TDD.**

## Usage

- `/dev <issue_url>` - Fetch issue, plan, and implement
- `/dev <issue_number>` - Same, using issue number (e.g. `/dev 5`)
- `/dev` - Ask user which issue to implement

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Understand

1. **Fetch the issue** using `gh issue view <number> --json title,body`
2. **Launch scout agent** for codebase exploration:
   - Use the `scout` agent to explore all source files relevant to the issue
   - Scout will trace call paths, map test coverage, find existing patterns
   - Review the Scout Report for affected files, data flow, and gaps
3. **Identify the gap** between current state and what the issue requires
4. **Challenge the PRD** if research reveals:
   - Missing requirements or overlooked edge cases
   - A better technical approach than what was suggested
   - Existing code that already partially solves the problem
   - Constraints or dependencies the PRD didn't account for
   - Requirements that are infeasible, overly complex, or conflict with existing code
   - Scope that should be split into separate issues

### Phase 1.5: PRD Feedback (when needed)

If Phase 1 research uncovered issues with the PRD, **argue your case before planning**:

5. **Present findings to the user** - explain what you found and what you'd change
6. **If user agrees**, invoke `/po amend <issue_number>` with a summary of the changes:
   - The PO will append a revision to the issue (original PRD stays intact)
   - Wait for the amended issue before proceeding to Phase 2
7. **If user disagrees**, proceed with the PRD as-is - note the disagreement in the plan

This is not a formality. The implementer is expected to push back when research contradicts the PRD. Better to fix the spec than to build the wrong thing.

### Phase 2: Plan

8. **Enter plan mode** to design the implementation:
   - Summarize research findings - what exists, what's missing, any PRD amendments
   - Break the issue into ordered implementation tasks (baby steps)
   - Each task = one testable behavior increment
   - Identify files to create/modify
   - Identify new types, functions, error types
   - Note dependencies between tasks
9. **Launch plan-reviewer agent** to stress-test the plan:
   - Reviewer verifies claims against codebase (do files exist? are patterns real?)
   - Finds gaps (missing error states, untested paths, edge cases)
   - Checks for over-engineering
   - Suggests better patterns from existing code
10. **Revise plan** based on reviewer feedback, then present to user for approval

### Phase 3: Implement (TDD)

11. **Create a feature branch**: `feat/<short-name>`
12. **For each task**, follow the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle below
13. **After all tasks complete**, launch `code-reviewer` agent for self-review:
    - Reviewer checks correctness, idioms, safety, architecture
    - Address any Critical or Important findings before committing

## The Cycle

For each behavior increment. One test at a time. Baby steps.

### RED - Write One Failing Test

Write the smallest possible test for the next behavior:

```rust
#[test]
fn frontmatter_extracts_title() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let content = "---\ntitle: Hello World\ndate: 2024-01-01\n---\nBody";
    let fm = frontmatter(content, "date");
    assert_eq!(fm.get("title"), Some(&"Hello World".to_string()));
    Ok(())
}
```

Run: `cargo test`

**The test MUST FAIL.** If it passes:
1. Re-examine the test - is it actually testing new behavior?
2. Adjust the assertion to target untested behavior
3. If it still passes after 3 attempts, **stop and ask the user**

### GREEN - Minimum Code to Pass

Write only enough production code to make the failing test pass. No more. No future-proofing.

Follow all codebase conventions from `CLAUDE.md`:
- Favor meaning in naming (no single-letter variables)
- Separation of concerns
- Idiomatic Rust

Run: `cargo test`

**The test MUST PASS.** If it fails:
1. Read the error carefully
2. Fix the implementation (not the test)
3. If it still fails after 5 attempts, **stop and ask the user**

### REFACTOR - Clean the Changed Code

Once green, refactor the changed code and its immediate boundaries. Baby steps only:

1. **Rename** - variables, functions, parameters to favor meaning
2. **Extract function** - if a block does one identifiable thing
3. **Inline** - remove unnecessary indirection
4. **Replace magic values** - constants or named functions
5. **Simplify conditionals** - `if let`, `match`, combinators
6. **Remove duplication** - only if 3+ occurrences

Run: `cargo test` after each refactor step - **must stay green**

### REPEAT

Go back to RED for the next behavior increment. Continue until the task is complete.

## Iron Rules

1. **No production code without a failing test** - ever
2. **Baby steps** - one test, one behavior, one increment
3. **Run tests after every change** - `cargo test`
4. **Refactor only when green** - never refactor red code
5. **One task at a time** - finish before starting the next
6. **Escalate, don't spin** - ask the user when stuck
7. **TDD is the default** - only skip if the user explicitly says so

## Implementation Checklist

For each task:

- [ ] Write first failing test
- [ ] Confirm test fails (RED)
- [ ] Write minimum code to pass
- [ ] Confirm test passes (GREEN)
- [ ] Refactor changed code (baby steps, tests stay green)
- [ ] Confirm tests still pass
- [ ] `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
- [ ] Repeat for next behavior increment
- [ ] All task behaviors covered
- [ ] Update all affected documentation (`CLAUDE.md`, doc comments) to reflect changes

## Pipeline

```
/po -> GitHub issue -> /dev -> /review -> /commit -> /pr
         ^                |
         |                | (PRD feedback)
         +--- /po amend --+
```
